# 👾 Emoji Scavenger Hunt 👾

Emoji Scavenger Hunt is an experimental web based game that makes use of TensorFlow.js to identify objects seen by your webcam or mobile camera in the browser. We show you emojis 🍌 ⏰ ☕️ 📱 and you have to find those objects in the real world before your timer runs out 🏆 👍.

Learn more about the experiment and try it for yourself at [g.co/emojiscavengerhunt](http://g.co/emojiscavengerhunt)


## Development

```sh
yarn prep
```

Running `yarn prep` will use yarn to get the right packages and setup the right folders. If you don't have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) you can install it via homebrew (for Mac). If you’re already running node/npm with nvm (our recommendation) you can install yarn without node using `brew install yarn --without-node`.

In order to start local development we also require the installation of the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads) and associated [App Engine Components](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/download). These are used for the local webserver and pushing to app engine for static site hosting.

Once you have both installed you can run the local development server with:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This task uses `watchify` to continually watch for changes to JS and SASS files and recompiles them if any changes are detected. You can access the local development server at `http://localhost:3000/`

When building assets for production use:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will minify SASS and JS for serving in production.

## Build your own model
You can build your own image recognition model by running a Docker container.

Before you start training, you'll need a set of images to teach the image
recognition model about the labels you want to recognize.
Prepare images for trainings and divide them into directories of the label
names.
If you are about to train a recognition model which classifies cat and dog,
the structure will look like below assuming image data are stored under
`data/images`.

```
data
└── images
    ├── cat
    │   ├── cat1.jpg
    │   ├── cat2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── dog
        ├── dog1.jpg
        ├── dog2.jpg
        └── ...
```

Once the training images are ready, you can kickstart the training by building
and running the docker container.

```
$ docker build -t model-builder .
$ docker run -v /path/to/data:/data -it model-builder
```

After the training is completed, you'll see three files in
`data/saved_model_web` directory:

- web_model.pb (the dataflow graph)
- weights_manifest.json (weight manifest file)
- group1-shard\*of\* (collection of binary weight files)

They are a SavedModel in a web-friendly format converted by
[TensorFlow.js converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter).
You can build your own game on your custom image recognition model by replacing
correspondings files under `dist/model/` directory with them.
You also need to update `src/js/scavenger_classes.ts` in order to label outputs
from the custom model with human-readable strings.
Update the game logic in `src/js/game.ts` if needed.

### Using GPU
You can boost training speed by utilizing GPU in general.
If you want to use GPU for training, install
[nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) and run:
```
$ nvidia-docker build -f Dockerfile.gpu model-builder
$ nvidia-docker run -v /path/to/data:/data -it model-builder
```
